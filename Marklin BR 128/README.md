## Needed for conversion

<ol>
<li>1x New circuit board for 21MTC</li>
<li>2x new circuit board for the lighting</li>
<li>2x 3D printed spacers to prevent light leakage</li>
</ol>

## ESU LokPilot 5 Programming
<ol>
<li>F1: high beam in the direction of travel</li>
<li>F2: Reserved for cabin lighting</li>
<li>F3: Shunting (only the right headlight on both sides of the locomotive lights up)</li>
<li>F5: switch off the rear light (to pull a train at the rear)</li>
<li>F6: switch off the front light (to pull a train in front)</li>
</ol>

The lighting F5 and F6 works because the rear LEDs are on AUX 1 & AUX 2 and switched separately.
